<p>I've found the <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/String.html#method-i-succ">Ruby's <code>String#next()</code> or <code>#succ</code></a> very useful and productive, specially when generating data for testing. Here is what the Ruby doc says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>succ -> new_str</p>

<p>next -> new_str</p>

<p>Returns the successor to str. The successor is calculated by incrementing characters starting from the rightmost alphanumeric (or the rightmost character > if there are no alphanumerics) in the string. Incrementing a digit always results in another digit, and incrementing a letter results in another letter > of the same case. Incrementing nonalphanumerics uses the underlying character sets collating sequence.</p>

<p>If the increment generates a carry, the character to the left of it is incremented. This process repeats until there is no carry, adding an additional > character if necessary.</p>

<pre><code>"abcd".succ        #=&gt; "abce"
"THX1138".succ     #=&gt; "THX1139"
"&lt;&lt;koala&gt;&gt;".succ   #=&gt; "&lt;&lt;koalb&gt;&gt;"
"1999zzz".succ     #=&gt; "2000aaa"
"ZZZ9999".succ     #=&gt; "AAAA0000"
"***".succ         #=&gt; "**+"
</code></pre>

<p>So when I saw Groovy actually has provided a <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/groovy-jdk/java/lang/String.html#next()">String extension <code>#next()</code></a> method, I was happy to try it out. But then I was quickly disappointed when the behavior is very different. The Groovy version is very simple and actually not very productive since it simply <a href="https://github.com/groovy/groovy-core/blob/master/src/main/org/codehaus/groovy/runtime/StringGroovyMethods.java">loop through Character set range in incrementally</a> (including non-printable characters blindly!). The Ruby's version, however, is much more productive since it produce visible characters. For examples:</p>

<pre><code>bash&gt; ruby -e 'puts "Z".next()'
AA
bash&gt; groovy -e 'println("Z".next())'
[
</code></pre>

<p>I wish Groovy version would improve in future as it's not very useful at the moment. Just for fun, I wrote a Java implementation version that mimics the Ruby's behavior:</p>

<p>And here is my unit test for sanity check:</p>
