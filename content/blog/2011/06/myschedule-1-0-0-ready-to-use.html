<span class="postbody">I have made MySchedule-1.0.0 ready to use.  <br />
<br />
MySchedule is an open source web application dashboard for Quartz scheduler. Get the war file here: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/myschedule/downloads/list" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/myschedule/downloads/list</a> <br />
<br />
It doesn't look pretty at the moment, but for those who are looking  for more Quartz examples, especially on how to use Spring and run  Quartz in a Web Container environment, the MySchedule project should get  you jump started quickly. <br />
