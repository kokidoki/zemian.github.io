<p>Did you know if you have been granted <code>sudo</code> access to a remote
host with <code>su</code> command, then you may switch to any user without the
need to type in their password?</p>
<p>Try this out:</p>
<pre><code>zemian@myhost bash&gt; sudo su - postgres
# When prompted for password, enter your own user account password.

# Now you are in as `postgres` user!
postgres@myhost bash&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Or if you want to switch to the root user directly, simply try:</p>
<pre><code>bash&gt; sudo su -
</code></pre>
<p>This is very useful when you need to switch to a user account that
was only setup just to run applications (eg: <code>postgres</code>, <code>mysql</code>,
<code>oracle</code>, or <code>weblogic</code> etc.) and not intented for real user. In this
case, you might not even know what the real password is. Above
trick should get you switch into that target user account.</p>
