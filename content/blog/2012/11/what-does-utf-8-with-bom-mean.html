Believe it or not, <i><b>There is no such thing as Plain Text!</b></i></div>

All files in a modern Operating Sytems (Windows, Linux, or MacOSX) are saved with an encoding scheme! They are encoded&nbsp;(a table mapping of what each byte means) in such way so that other programs can read it back and understand how to get&nbsp;information out. It happens that US/ASCII encoding is earliest and widely used that people think it's just "Plain Tex".&nbsp;But even ASCII is an encoding! It uses 7 bits in mapping all US characters in saving the bytes into file. Obviously you&nbsp;are free to use any kind of encoding (mapping) scheme to save any files, but if you want other programs to read it back&nbsp;easily, then sticking to some standard ones would help a lot. Without an agreed upon encoding, programs will not able&nbsp;to read files and be any useful!</div>

The most useful and practical file encoding today is "UTF-8" because it support Unicode, and it's widely used in internet.</div>

I discovered something odd when using Eclipse and Notepadd++. In Ecilpse, if we set default encoding with UTF-8, it would&nbsp;use normal UTF-8 without the Byte Order Mark (BOM). But in Notepad++, it appears to support UTF-8 wihtout BOM, but it won't&nbsp;recoginze it when first open. You can check this by going Menu &gt; Encoding and see which one is selected. Notepad++ seems&nbsp;to only recognize UTF-8 wihtout BOM with ones it converted by it's own conversion utility. Perhaps it's a bug in notepad++.</div>

<span style="color: #222222;">So what is BOM? The byte order mark is useless for UTF-8. They only used for UTF-16 so they know which byte order is first.&nbsp;But UTF-8 will allow you to save these BOM for conversion purpose... they are ineffective in encoding the doc itself. So&nbsp;a "normal" UTF-8, it won't have BOM, but Windows would like to use them anyway. </span><b><span style="color: #660000;">The Windows NOTEPAD would automatically save&nbsp;BOM in UTF-8!</span></b></div>

<br /></div>

So be-aware when viewing UTF-8 without BOM encoding files in Notepad++, as it can be deceiving at first glance.</div>
