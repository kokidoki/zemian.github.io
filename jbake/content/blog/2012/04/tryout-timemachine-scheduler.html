There are few updates with TimeMachine Scheduler project:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>The project has a new home:&nbsp;
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/timemachine/scheduler/wiki/Home">https://bitbucket.org/timemachine/scheduler/wiki/Home</a>&nbsp;</li>
<li>I've been updating with SNAPSHOT downloads frequently lately, and the zip file binary distribution is fairly stable now. We are close to making the first official release.</li>
<li>I've been working hard to update the ReferenceManual under wiki so users can get started and use it effectively.</li>
</ol>
