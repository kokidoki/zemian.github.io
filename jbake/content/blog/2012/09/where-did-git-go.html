My git is gone after I upgraded to latest MacOSX updates! What a annoying thing.

Appearently it's in here now: <code>/usr/local/git/bin/git</code>

You can edit your <code>$PATH</code> like it says <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6810059/git-on-mac-os-x-lion">here</a>, or you could just relink it.
<pre>
ln -s /usr/local/git/bin/git /usr/local/bin/git
</pre>
