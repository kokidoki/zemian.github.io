Quartz project has little development activities for quite some time now. I finally able to put in some time and help get many bugs fixed up. After more than two years since Quartz last release (April 2017), I am happy to annouce the https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.quartz-scheduler/quartz/2.3.1/jar[quartz-2.3.1] is finally out!

This release is a minor release that https://github.com/quartz-scheduler/quartz/releases/tag/quartz-2.3.1[fixed many bugs] on the 2.3 series that uses JDK 7. We also cleaned up the http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/[documentation] that generated from `asciidoc` and placed it along with the source repository.

Our https://github.com/quartz-scheduler/quartz[master branch] now target the next https://github.com/quartz-scheduler/quartz/milestone/6[quartz 2.4.0 milestone], which will support the JDK 8 build.
