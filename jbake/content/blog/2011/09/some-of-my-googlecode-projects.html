I have created number of googlecode projects in attempt to try out new codes and ideas in the past. I now have links to all of them in my consolidated playground area&nbsp;<a href="http://code.google.com/p/zemiandeng/">http://code.google.com/p/zemiandeng/</a><br />
<br />
I also kept few Java project templates (Maven based) in there:&nbsp;<a href="http://code.google.com/p/zemiandeng/source/browse/">http://code.google.com/p/zemiandeng/source/browse/</a>&nbsp;These can get you started a project fairly quickly. See the README.txt in each for more details. I have added:<br />
&nbsp; * java-project-template<br />
&nbsp; * servlet-project-template<br />
&nbsp; * springmvc-project-template<br />
<br />
There is also the "java-tool" with misc command line programs that I have collected over the years.<br />
<br />
I also have stored a more reasonable preferences with Eclipse workspace, and few more custom Cygwin/Bash scripts setup.<br />
