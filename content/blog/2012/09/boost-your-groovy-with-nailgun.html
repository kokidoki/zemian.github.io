<p>Are you working on a large Hibernate project that takes long time to load up all the <code>hbm.xml</code> files when creating the 
<code>Session</code> object? This is fine during deployment and runtime because it only loads it once. However, often time we also 
need to the same <code>Session</code> object to do some ad-hoc <code>HQL</code> queries to debug or validate data. Loading and re-loading
large mapping files in a <code>Session</code> to just execute single query is very painful.</p>

<p>Now, I like to poke around Java things with <code>Groovy</code>, and it's a great tool to peek at your data as ad-hoc queries as well. 
You can easily do this with their <code>groovyConsole</code> GUI tool and add <code>--classpath</code> option to include your project classes. This
will bring up a tiny Editor, and you can script to load your hibernate <code>Session</code> there. Once the first run is loaded (the 
hibenrate <code>Session</code> created), then second run is almost in an instant.</p>

<p>Running the little <code>groovyConsole</code> had wet my appetite, and I was hungry for a better text editor, but yet I don't really
want a full blow IDE for scripting. I like do my scripting in a plain editor. Now if you have an editor such as <a href="http://sublimetext.com">Sublime Text 2</a> (ST2) that has a "build" feature to execute a external command, then you will enjoy scripting much more. With
ST2, I can have it call <code>groovy.bat</code> from inside the editor on the script that I am editing. However, there is another problem: the external command will restart a new JVM process on each run! Now I am back to square one.</p>

<p>To solve this problem, and still have my cake (editor), I recalled an awesome tool called <a href="http://www.martiansoftware.com/nailgun/index.html">NailGun</a>. This works perfectly with Groovy and my problem. I can start a server like this</p>

<pre><code>java -cp "groovy-all-2.0.1.jar:nailgun-0.7.1.jar" -server com.martiansoftware.nailgun.NGServer
</code></pre>

<p>And then in my ST2 editor, I can run an external command like this as the NailGun client:</p>

<pre><code>/path/to/nailgun-0.7.1/ng groovy.ui.GroovyMain test.groovy
</code></pre>

<p>Nail gun client sends the script file content to the server and prints the result. Again, after first run, the second run should
be instantaneously.</p>

<p>There, I scratched my itch.</p>

<h1>Details on how to setup Sublime Text 2 to run NailGun client</h1>

<p><ol>
<li>Go to menu: "Preference > Browse Packages"</li>
<li>Open the Groovy folder</li>
<li>Save a file named "GroovyNailGunClient.sublime-build" with the following:
<pre>
   {
     "cmd": ["/path/to/nailgun-0.7.1/ng", "groovy.ui.GroovyMain", "$file"],
     "file_regex": "^(...<em>?):([0-9]</em>):?([0-9]*)",
     "selector": "source.groovy"
   }
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Select menu "Tool > Build System > GroovyNailGunClient"</li>
  <li>Press <code>CTRL+B</code> to run any groovy file in your editor.</li>
  </ol></p>
