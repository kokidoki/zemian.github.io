Cygwin has this cool command called <code>cygstart</code>, and I usually alias it as <code>open</code>.
 
<pre>
alias open='cygstart'
</pre>
 
Here are few things I use often:
<pre>
 
# bring up Windows Explore with folder open
bash> open /cygdrive/c/temp
bash> open "$USERPROFILE"
 
# bring up browser on a url
bash> open http://google.com
 
# bring up any windows program by file extension
bash> open /cygdrive/c/my.docx
</pre>
 
<p>Because I use a Cygwin terminal shell a lot, I have many alias shortcuts to many different directories. The <code>open .</code> allows me to jump to any directory and starts the Windows Explore with that directory expanded quickly. You can see more options with <code>open --help</code>.
